You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!

* I learned about semantic HTML

* Pretty much the whole exercise was easy for me

* Nothing so far in this exercise

* I did not run in to any problems with this exercise, however I am using
Google, StackOverflow, Books, Blogs and different communities to help get through
most of the common problems I face in the next projects (Iâ€™m already working on those).
